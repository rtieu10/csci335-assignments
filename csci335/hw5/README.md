One resource I used in order to complete this project was the textbook. When I initially started the project, I attempted to implement the adjacency list with a vector within a vector. After reading the textbook, and accessing online resources, I realized that it may be considered an adjacency matrix over an adjacency list. By using the textbook I was able to read about the textbook implementation and transitioned into using a map where the key was the node that the vertex was connected to and the key was the weight.

I also watched youtube videos to gain a deeper understanding of Dijkstra's algorithm. One thing I struggled was with understanding the way that we are meant to keep track of the path, and the nodes we have already visited. By watching youtube videos, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of what data structure to use to keep track of the nodes that we visited. Additionally, it was helpful in understanding the concepts behind the Dijkstra's algorithm.
