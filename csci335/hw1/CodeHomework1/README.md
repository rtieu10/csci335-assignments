For question 1, I implemented a permute function which uses recursion in order to iterate through
the string and return all the possible permuted strings. One thing I had difficulty with was approaching the
problem recursively. I completed the question in its entirety.

For question 2, I completed the task of implementing the big five, and also overloaded all the operators.
One thing I struggled with what implementing the copy constructor, once I overloaded the '+' operator, I ran into
issues with the copy constructor even though I got points for it on gradescope. I revisited the copy constructor
and I was able to debug it, I realized I was not properly copying the vales into the object. Another difficulty
was understanding the semantics of the move constructor and the move assignment since I had never implemented them
in my programs.
