For the second part of this homework assignment, I referenced the textbook in order to learn more about AVL trees, and their rotations. I also watched a youtube video in order to get a better visual understanding of the AVL rotations. For the later parts of the project I had a study group with my friends in the library where we talked about different approaches for implementing a counter. For the SequenceMap, I referenced the class notes to gain a better understanding of how hashtables work, in terms of a key value pair. Similar to how the recognition_string_ maps to an enzyme_acronym_ vector. I also referenced some of my code from 235 to refresh my memory on the implementation of stringstream with delimiters.
