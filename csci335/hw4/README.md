For this homework assignment, one challenge that I faced was understanding Comparators. I had never implemented them in
a program before so I used online references to learn more about how they work. I also referenced the textbook to
further my understanding of the implementation of Comparators. I also had to further my understanding of using median3
to choose the pivot for the quicksort sorting algorithms. For this project, one challenge I faced was a lot of testing and making sure that the elements in the vectors were in the appropriate order. I also had to revise my VerifyOrder function in order to make sure it outputted the correct values for the final submission.
